=================
Transition to 2.9
=================

Overall
=======

**Compilation feature for faster performance!** Read `this chapter <https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compilation.html>`_ for tutorial, particularly its restrictions section.

**Docstrings of all classes were overhauled.** Check the `Core API pages <https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#api-reference>`_.


General classes
-----------------

All constructs: `parse build sizeof` methods take context entries ONLY as keyword parameters \*\*kw (see `this chapter <https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/meta.html>`_)

All constructs: `compile benchmark testcompiled` methods were added (see `this chapter <https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compilation.html#compiling-schemas>`_)

Compiled CompilableMacro Decompiled added (used internally)

String* classes require explicit encoding (see `this page <https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html#strings>`_)

String* classes (all of them) support UTF16 UTF32 encodings, but String CString dropped some parameters

Enum FlagsEnum can merge labels from IntEnum IntFlag (enum module), but dropped `default` parameter

Struct Sequence Union FocusedSeq are nesting context (in parse build and sizeof)

Struct Sequence Union FocusedSeq are supporting new embedding semantics (see `this page <https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/meta.html#nesting-and-embedding>`_)

Array reimplemented without Range, does not use stream.tell()

If IfThenElse renamed `predicate` parameter to `condfunc`

RestreamData added

ExprAdapter Restreamed Mapping* classes changed parameters order (decoders before endcoders)

HexString removed


Exceptions
-------------

FieldError was replaced with StreamError (raised when stream returns less than requested amount) and FormatFieldError (raised by FormatField class, for example if building Float from non-float value and struct.pack complains).

StreamError can be raised by most classes, when the stream is not seekable or tellable

StringError can be raised by most classes, when expected bytes but given unicode value

BitIntegerError was replaced with IntegerError

Struct Sequence can raise IndexError and KeyError when dictionaries are missing entries

RepeatError added

RawCopyError added
